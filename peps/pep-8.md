## Introduction

The congruency checker is a system in the DataPortal that checks user generated EML metadata and CSV tables, and provides user feedback in the form of a report with any issues that were detected, including severity levels, and suggestions for improvements. 

This is a proposal to replace the current congruency checker, which has known issues, with a new implementation in the form of a library that can be used in all places where we ingest user generated data, including the DataPortal, ezEML and DeX.
