## What is a PEP?

PEP stands for **PASTA Enhancement Proposal** and borrows extensively from the Python community's *Python Enhancement Proposal* process (see [here](https://peps.python.org/pep-0001)). We are fortunate (LOL) that we can reuse the PEP acronym to our advantage (while the first "P" in PEP is for "PASTA", we will extend it to all technical proposals related to the Environmental Data Initiative (EDI) project).

A PEP is a document that serves as a blueprint for EDI and its community. Its purpose is to propose *significant* additions or modifications (including removal) to the design or implementation of EDI developed software, processes, or technical policy. PEPs will be reviewed and decided upon by the EDI technical steering council. We emphasize that a PEP should only be written when considering a major technical change within EID, while avoiding its use for bug fixes or minor enhancements such as comsmetic improvements to UI components. When in doubt, ask the steering council if a PEP would be required.

The PEP process will gather feedback from the community, and record design decisions made for the proposals. PEPs provide a written document ensuring both transparency and  The author of a PEP is responsible for building concensus within the community and noting any disagreements or concerns.

Each PEP should contain a clear technical outline of what is being proposed, along with the rationale behind it.

Since PEPs are stored as text files in a version-controlled repository, their history is preserved. This means anyone can review how a PEP evolved over time, either through git commands or by browsing the history on [GitHub](https://github.com/PASTAplus/PEP).

## PEP Audience

The expected audience for a PEP is two-fold: the primary user is an internal developer or technical editor of EDI, while the secondary user is a community member.
