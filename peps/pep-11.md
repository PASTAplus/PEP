## Introduction

The PASTA software stack currently uses block storage for all data resources published to the Environmental Data Initiative (EDI) data repository. EDI is migrating PASTA services (virtual machines, system storage, and data storage) to Amazon Web Services (AWS). As part of this move, EDI plans to utilize AWS's Scalable Storage System (S3) for all published data resources. The following proposal outlines the organization and storage classification of data resources using objects within S3 buckets.
