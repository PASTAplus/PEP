## Introduction

In some cases, it would be invaluable to associate a thumbnail image with a 
data entity. This PEP proposes a mechanism for associating a thumbnail image 
with a data entity.

## Issue Statement

Data entities can be described by a variety of text-based metadata. However, a
visual representation of the data entity can be useful for users to quickly
identify the composition of a data entity. Unfortunately, there is no standard
mechanism for associating a thumbnail image with a data entity in the 
Ecological Metadata Language (EML).
