## Introduction

Protecting digital resources through access control is paramount to the EDI Identity and Access Management (IAM) model (see [PEP-7](./pep-7.md)). Digital resources in the EDI ecosystem can be anything, inlcuding the elements of a data package (e.g., metadata, quality report, or data), web-service API methods, the scope values of data package identifiers, web-application actions (e.g., forms or links), or metadata models created and edited in *ezEML*. These resources require protection from malicious and non-malicious actions through the use of access control rules (ACRs), which codify how a user of an EDI application may act upon a resource.

The following PEP proposes the development of an *authorization service* that unifies access control across all EDI applications. It will improve application scalability and eliminate idiosyncratic access control behavior of "stove-pipe" solutions. A single *authorization service* will greatly improve EDI's IAM model in three ways:

1. It will provide an ecosystem-wide, centralized service with a standard interface available for use by all EDI applications to manage access control rules.
2. It will use *PASTA IDs* ([see PEP-2](./pep-2.md)) generated by the EDI *authentication service* in lieu of IdP identifiers (which border on  personally identifiable information).
3. It will allow access control rules for resources to be created and modified at any time.

## Background 

Historically, access control for EDI revolved around the core repository, PASTA, where static access control rules, codified in user-provided [Ecological Metadata Language](https://eml.ecoinformatics.org) (EML) metadata documents, dictated who may read and update the science metadata and data of a data package. These ACRs are declared using the [`<access>`](https://eml.ecoinformatics.org/schema/eml_xsd#eml_access) element (Figure 1) of the EML XML schema (multiple rules can be defined within a single `<access>` element, creating an access control list (ACL)).

![](./images/pep9-EML_access_element.png)<!--{ width=65% }-->

**Figure 1:** XML schema diagram for an Ecological Metadata Language `<access>` element.

For an EML `<access>` element (see example in Listing 1), the access control rule can either "allow" or "deny" access to the data package's resources (the specific resource in question depends on where in the document the rule is defined). The type of access enforced by the rule is defined by `<access>` sub-elements `<allow>` and `<deny>` (although a "deny" action is permitted to explicitly revoke a privilege on a resource, it is rarely used in practice). Within an `<allow>` or `<deny>` element, the subject and privilege of the ACR is defined by the `<principal>` and `<permission>` sub-elements. For EDI, the value of the `<principal>` element can be any string but generally consists of the unique identity assigned to a user by an Identity Provider (IdP) or is an arbitrary group identifier (e.g., "authenticated"). In contrast, the value of the `<permission>` element can only be one of the following:

* **read** (to gain immutable "read" access to a resource),
* **write** (to gain mutable "create", "read" , "update", and "delete" access to a resource), or
* **changePermission** (to everything in *write*, along with the privilege to alter other's access to a resource).

(These specific permissions are not part of the EML `<access>` element schema; they are legacy and were defined by the Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) Network information management community.)

```xml
<access>
  <allow>
    <principal>uid=mark,o=EDI,dc=edirepository,dc=org</principal>
    <permission>read</permission>
  </allow>
</access>
```
**Listing 1:** Example definition of an Ecological Metadata Language `<access>` element. If found in metadata describing data in a file named `table.csv`, this ACR can be read informally as "the user, `uid=mark,o=EDI,dc=edirepository,dc=org`, *is allowed permission to read* the data contained within `table.csv`."

> *Side note*: An `<access>` element ACR may be read as an [RDF triple](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/#section-triples) **<subject, predicate, object>**, where the *principal* in the ACR is the **subject**, the combination of either "allow" or "deny", along with the *permission*, is the **predicate**, and the protected resource is the **object** .

ACLs for PASTA API methods are declared in a standalone XML document file, `service.xml`, one each for the Data Package Manager (DPM) and Audit Manager (AM) services. These ACLs are read into the system during the PASTA bootstrap process and can be changed by editing the file and restarting the system.

ACLs for data package resources are declared in the data package's EML metadata document and are translated from XML and stored in the `access_matrix` RDBS table as single ACRs when the data package EML is first uploaded into the repository; these ACRs cannot be modified once they are entered into the table. Data package ACLs can occur at two levels: (1) at the "data package" level, which sets the permissions for all data package resources (i.e., metadata, quality report, and data entities) and (2) at the "data entity" level, which sets permissions for individual data entities and overides permissions set at the "data package" level (it is not uncommon to set "public" read access to the metadata and quality report, but restrict "public" access to data entities).

Both the `service.xml` file and EML metadata use the same XML `<access>` element structure, allowing use of the same ACR processor to determine authorization. In both cases, ACRs allowing access to resources must be explicitly granted, otherwise the resource request is denied.

For ezEML, there is an implicit **write** permission for the owner of a resource. In this case, the owner is identified through the IdP identifier provided through the PASTA authentication token. Resources are held in filesystem directories that map to the owner's identifier and only the owner of the directory may create or modify resources within it. There is exception to this rule where the owner of the resource may grant temporary **write** access to another user of ezEML, enabling collaboration. This process, however, does not provide permanent access to the resource and is revoked when the proxy user completes their actions.

## Issue Statement

The current use of access management within EDI applications has the following issues:

1. Applications within the EDI ecosystem are faced with designing and implementing access management processing in isolation. This leads to idiosyncratic, non-interoperable solutions for a customer base that transcends all EDI applications, resulting in confusion and, at worse, security breaches.
2. IdP user identifiers and group identifiers are embedded in existing ACRs, which are visible to the public by reviewing the data package XML metadata. This can disclose private or sensitive information, including names, email addresses, and alternative identifiers (e.g., Orcid identifiers). These identifiers also become a permanent record in the EDI data repository audit log, which is another potential exposure of sensitive information.
3. Existing ACRs used in most EDI applications, especially those used for data package resources, are static and immutable once defined. Access control for resources should be dynamic so administrators and users alike can easily create new ACRs, as well as modify and update existing ACRs. In practice, this would allow a resource owner to add (or remove) access to the resource for a user during the life-time of the resource, not just when the resource is created.

## Proposed Solution

We propose to design and implement an *authorization service* that will perform access management for all types of resources used within EDI applications (Figure 2). Because this service shares related content with the authentication service, both services will be combined and operate on the same server using the same Python FastAPI web framework and Postgresql database.

This service will be responsible for the following:

1. Implement a secure and verifiable authorization algorithm that will process ACRs for EDI resources.
2. Support all applications and their respective resources in the EDI ecosystem.
3. Maintain a secure and private ACR registry with the necessary attributes to perform authorization based on #1.
4. Provide a REST API for managing ACRs, including the ability to add, modify, and delete ACRs by users who have "changePermission" privileges to the resource (i.e., an owner of the resource).
5. Provide a web browser UI frontend for managing ACRs for both EDI administrators and users.

### Access Control Rule Registry

The AuthZ ACR registry will be implemented as RDBMS tables with the following schema (Figure 3):

![](images/pep9-acl-tables.png)

**Figure 3:** Authorization service ACR registry table schema.

The ACR Registry stores ACRs for all applications in the EDI ecosystem. We use a structure with collections, resources, and permissions. A collection contains zero to many resources, and a resource contains zero to many permissions. Each permission provides read, write or ownership to either a user profile or a user group. A user profile can be a regular user or a system level user, such as the public user.

#### Collection

- `id` - An auto-incrementing integer that uniquely identifies each table row.
- `collection.label` - A human-readable name to display for the collection.
- `collection.type` - A string that describes the type of the collection.
- `collection.created_date` - The date and time the collection was created.

#### Resource

- `resource.collection_id` - A reference to the collection to which the resource belongs.
- `resource.key` - A unique identifier for the resource.
- `resource.label` - A human-readable name for the resource.
- `resource.type` - The resource type.
- `resource.created_date` - The date and time the resource was created.

#### Permission

- `permission.resource_id` - A reference to the resource to which the permission applies.
- `permission.principal_id` - A reference to the user profile or group to which the permission is granted.
- `permission.principal_type` - The principal class (enum of PROFILE or GROUP) of the permission.
- `permission.level` - The access level granted by this permission (enum of 'read', 'write' or 'changePermission').
- `permission.granted_date` - The grant date and time of the permission.

For example, if we are tracking permissions for a data package with metadata and data entities, the `collection.label` might be `knb-lter-bes.1234.5`, and the `collection.type` would be `package`. Linked to this collection would be a number of resources. Each resource would have a `resource.collection_id` referencing the `knb-lter-bes.1234.5` collection. The `resource.label` might be `water.csv` while the `resource.key` would be the PASTA URI `https://pasta.lternet.edu/package/data/eml/knb-lter-bes.1234.5/3fb3ef2e559fa42956b69226e9069058`. The `resource.type` would be `data`. Permissions would then be linked to these resources via `permission.resource_id`. Each permission would have a `permission.principal_id` of a user profile or user group, and a `permission.principal_type` of either `PROFILE` or `GROUP`. The `permission.level` would specify the level of access granted to the principal, and would be `read`, `write` or `changePermission`.


### Authorization algorithm

Premises for the authorization algorithm are as follows:

1. All principals are denied access to all resources unless an ACR exists that explicitly allows access.
2. An ACR only defines "allow" access to a resource. "Deny" access is not supported.
3. If multiple ACRs exist for a resource that affect the same user, the most permissive ACR is applied. For example, if one ACR allows read access and another allows write access, the write access is applied. Similarly, if one ACR allows read access for a user and another allows write access for a group to which the user belongs, the write access is applied.

The AuthZ authorization algorithm requires three parameters:

1. The resource identifier to be accessed.
2. The set of principals attempting to access the resource.
3. The requested permission for the resource. The permission is an integer value that represents the access level requested by the principal (read = 1, write = 2, changePermission = 3).

The algorithm is as follows:
```python
def is_authorized(resource: str, principals: set, permission: int) -> bool:
    authorized = False
    acrs = getACRs(resource)
    for principal in principals:
        for acr in acrs:
            if acr.principal == principal:
                if acr.permission <= permission:
                    authorized = True
    return authorized
```
### PASTA Integration

There are three primary integration points between AuthZ and PASTA:

1. Data package resource ACR registration ([see UML here](./images/pep9-data_package_resource_add_ACL-Data_Package_Life_Cycle_Authorization.png)).
2. Service method authorization ([see UML here](./images/pep9-service_method_authZ-Service_Method_Authorization.png)).
3. Data package resource authorization ([see UML here](./images/pep9-data_resource_authZ-Read_Resource_Authorization.png)).

Each integration point is selected to minimize the impact on the existing PASTA architecture and to provide a seamless transition to the new AuthZ service.

### Use Case and REST API Method Definitions

**1a. Add ACL**

Goal: To parse a valid EML document and add its ACRs to the AuthZ ACR registry for the resources identified in the EML document.

Use case:

1. The Data Package Manager requests that that ACRs be created from the EML document.
2. AuthZ parses the EML and extracts the ACRs.
3. AuthZ adds the ACRs to the ACR registry.
4. AuthZ returns a success message to PASTA.

Notes: This use case supports the existing PASTA data package upload process. Parsing and extracting ACRs from the EML document will require supporting ACRs in both the main EML document and the additional metadata section. The principal owner of the data package is not currently represented in the ACR registry. This should, however, change for consistency: the principal owner should be added into the ACR registry with the "changePermission" permission.

```
addACL(owner: string, eml: string)
    owner: The principal owner of the data package (may be either a PASTA-ID or an IdP identifier)
    eml: valid EML document as a string
    return:
        200 OK if successful
        4xx Bad Request if EML is invalid
    body:
        Empty if 200, error message otherwise
    permissions:
        system: changePermission
```

**1b. Add ACL**

Goal: To parse a valid `<access>` element and add its ACRs to the AuthZ ACR registry.

Use case:

1. An EDI application creates an `<access>` element ACL for an EDI resource.
2. The application sends the `<access>` element ACL to AuthZ to register the ACR.
3. AuthZ parses the `<access>` element ACL and extracts the ACRs.
4. AuthZ adds the ACRs to the ACR registry.
5. AuthZ returns a success message to the EDI application.

Notes: This use case supports adding ACLs for PASTA API methods through the `service.xml` file. In this case, the `service.xml` file is not a complete EML document; they consist of ACLs in the form of `<access>` elements. The principal owner of the service method (or other resource) should be added into the ACR registry with the "changePermission" permission; in the case of service methods, the principal owner will be "pasta."

```
addACL(owner: string, resource_key: string, access: string)
    owner: owner of resource (derived from "sub" of JWT) as a string
    resource_key: unique key of resource that the <access> element applies to
    access: valid <access> element as a string
    return:
        200 OK if successful
        4xx Bad Request if <access> element is invalid
    permissions:
        system: changePermission
```

**2a. Set ACR**

Goal: To create an ACR if the ACR does not exist

Use case:

1. An EDI application creates an ACR for an EDI resource.
2. The application sends the ACR to AuthZ to register the ACR.
3. AuthZ validates and adds the ACR to the ACR registry.
4. AuthZ returns a success message to the EDI application.

Notes: This use case supports adding individual ACRs for applications that do not use EML or `<access>` elements.

```
addACR(resource_key: string, principal: string, permission: string)
    resource_key: the resource identifier of the resource to be protected by the ACR as a string
    principal: the principal of the ACR as a string
    permission: the permission of the ACR as a string
    return:
        200 OK if successful
        400 Bad Request if ACR is invalid
    permissions:
        system: changePermission
        authenticated: changePermission
```

**2b. Set ACR**

Goal: To modify an ACR if it exists

Use case:

1. An EDI application creates an ACR for an EDI resource.
2. The application sends the ACR to AuthZ to register the ACR.
3. AuthZ validates and adds the ACR to the ACR registry.
4. AuthZ returns a success message to the EDI application.

Notes: This use case supports adding individual ACRs for applications that do not use EML or `<access>` elements.

```
addACR(resource_key: string, principal: string, permission: string)
    resource_key: the resource identifier of the resource to be protected by the ACR as a string
    principal: the principal of the ACR as a string
    permission: the permission of the ACR as a string
    return:
        200 OK if successful
        400 Bad Request if ACR is invalid
    permissions:
        system: changePermission
        authenticated: changePermission
```

**2. Add ACR**

Goal: To add an individual ACR as defined by ACR attributes to the AuthZ ACR registry.

Use case:

1. An EDI application creates an ACR for an EDI resource.
2. The application sends the ACR to AuthZ to register the ACR.
3. AuthZ validates and adds the ACR to the ACR registry.
4. AuthZ returns a success message to the EDI application.

Notes: This use case supports adding individual ACRs for applications that do not use EML or `<access>` elements.

```
addACR(resource_key: string, principal: string, permission: string)
    resource_key: the resource identifier of the resource to be protected by the ACR as a string
    principal: the principal of the ACR as a string
    permission: the permission of the ACR as a string
    return:
        200 OK if successful
        400 Bad Request if ACR is invalid
    permissions:
        system: changePermission
        authenticated: changePermission
```

**3. Delete ACR**

Goal: To delete an individual ACR from the AuthZ ACR registry.

Use case:

1. An EDI application selects an ACR identifier, identifying an ACR that should be deleted from the ACR registry.
2. The application sends the ACR identifier to AuthZ to delete the ACR.
3. AuthZ deletes the ACR from the ACR registry.
4. AuthZ returns a success message to the EDI application.

Notes:

```
deleteACR(acr_id: int)
    acr_id: the ACR identifier of the ACR to be removed as an integer
    return:
        200 OK if successful
        404 Bad Request if ACR is not found in the ACR registry
    permissions:
        system: changePermission
        vetted: write
```

**4. Update ACR**

Goal: To update an individual ACR in the AuthZ ACR registry.

Use case:

1. An EDI application selects an ACR identifier, identifying an ACR that should be updated in the ACR registry.
2. The application sends the ACR identifier, along with the new ACR attributes, to AuthZ to update the ACR.
3. AuthZ updates the ACR in the ACR registry.
4. AuthZ returns a success message to the EDI application.

Notes: This use case can also be accomplished by deleting the ACR and adding a new ACR with the same ACR attributes; however, doing so would require two API calls and result in a new ACR identifier.

```
updateACR(acr_id: int, resource_id: string, principal: string, permission: string)
    acr_id: the ACR identifier of the ACR to be removed as an integer
    resource_id: the resource identifier of the resource to be protected by the ACR as a string
    principal: the principal of the ACR as a string
    permission: the permission of the ACR as a string
    return:
        200 OK if successful
        404 Bad Request if ACR is not found in the ACR registry
    permissions:
        system: changePermission
        vetted: write
```

**5. Read ACR**

Goal: To read the attributes of an individual ACR in the AuthZ ACR registry based on the resource identifier.

Use case:

1. A client application selects an ACR by providing a resource identifier.
2. The application sends the resource identifier to AuthZ.
3. AuthZ verifies the client application has privileges to read the ACR.
4. AuthZ returns the attributes of the ACR based on the resource identifier.

Notes: None

```
readACR(resource_key: string)
    resource_key: the resource identifier of the resource to be protected by the ACR as a string
    return:
        200 OK if successful
        404 Bad Request if ACR is not found in the ACR registry
    permissions:
        system: changePermission
        authenticated: changePermission
```

**6a. Is Authorized**

Goal: To determine if a principal is authorized to access a resource.

Use case:

1. An EDI application collects the user's authentication token, the `<access>` element for the protected resource, and the requested permission.
2. The application sends the token, `<access>` element, and permission to AuthZ to determine if the user is authorized.
3. AuthZ processes the request and returns a success message if the user is authorized.

Notes: This use case supports the authorization process for PASTA API methods if the ACLs in the  `service.xml` file are not registered in AuthZ's ACR registry.

```
isAuthorized(token: string, resource_key: string, access: string, permission: string)
    token: a valid PASTA authentication token as a string
    resource_key:
    access: a valid <access> element as a string
    permission: the permission to be checked as a string
    return:
        200 OK if authorized
        403 Forbidden if not authorized
    permissions:
        system: changePermission
```

**6b. Is Authorized**

Goal: To determine if a principal is authorized to access a resource.

Use case:

1. An EDI application collects the user's authentication token, the resource identifier for the protected resource, and the requested permission.
2. The application sends the token, resource identifier, and permission to AuthZ to determine if the user is authorized.
3. AuthZ processes the request and returns a success message if the user is authorized.

Notes: This use case supports the authorization process for data package resources where it is assumed that ACRs exist in the ACR registry.

```
isAuthorized(token: string, resource_key: string, permission: string)
    token: a valid PASTA authentication token as a string
    resource_key: the resource identifier of the resource to be accessed as a string
    permission: the permission to be checked as a string
    return:
        200 OK if authorized
        403 Forbidden if not authorized
    permissions:
        system: changePermission
```

**6c. Is Authorized**

Goal: To determine if a principal is authorized to access a resource.

Use case:

1. An EDI application collects the user's JSON Web Token, the `<access>` element for the protected resource, and the requested permission.
2. The application sends the token, `<access>` element, and permission to AuthZ to determine if the user is authorized.
3. AuthZ processes the request and returns a success message if the user is authorized.

Notes: This use case supports the authorization process for PASTA API methods if the ACLs in the  `service.xml` file are not registered in AuthZ's ACR registry.

```
isAuthorized(jwt: string, access: string, permission: string)
    jwt: a valid JSON Web Token as a string
    access: a valid <access> element as a string
    permission: the permission to be checked as a string
    return:
        200 OK if authorized
        403 Forbidden if not authorized
    permissions:
        system: changePermission
```

**6d. Is Authorized**

Goal: To determine if a principal is authorized to access a resource.

Use case:

1. An EDI application collects the user's JSON Web Token, the `<access>` element for the protected resource, and the requested permission.
2. The application sends the token, `<access>` element, and permission to AuthZ to determine if the user is authorized.
3. AuthZ processes the request and returns a success message if the user is authorized.

Notes: This use case supports the authorization process for PASTA API methods if the ACLs in the  `service.xml` file are not registered in AuthZ's ACR registry.

```
isAuthorized(jwt: string, access: string, permission: string)
    jwt: a valid JSON Web Token as a string
    resource_id: the resource identifier of the resource to be accessed as a string
    permission: the permission to be checked as a string
    return:
        200 OK if authorized
        403 Forbidden if not authorized
    permissions:
        system: changePermission
```

**7. Get Owned Resources**

Goal: Return a list of resources owned by the identity, including groups, declared in the JWT. 

Use case:

1. An EDI application collects the user's JSON Web Token, the `<access>` element for the protected resource, and the requested permission.
2. The application sends the token, `<access>` element, and permission to AuthZ to determine if the user is authorized.
3. AuthZ processes the request and returns a success message if the user is authorized.

Notes: This use case supports the authorization process for PASTA API methods if the ACLs in the  `service.xml` file are not registered in AuthZ's ACR registry.

```
getOwnedResources(owner: string, access: string, permission: string)
    jwt: a valid JSON Web Token as a string
    return:
        200 OK if authorized
        403 Forbidden if not authorized
    permissions:
        system: changePermission
```

### Implementation Strategy for PASTA

The **AuthZ** service must integrate seamlessly into PASTA's current authorization workflow. Three separate tasks must be addressed: (1) Service method ACRs for both the DPM and AM services must be migrated to the **AuthZ** ACR registry; (2) the existing `access_matrix` database table, including principal owners stored in the DPM `resource_registry` database table, must be migrated to the **AuthZ** ACR registry with PASTA IDs; and (3) the DPM service must be modified to use the REST API methods of the **AuthZ** service (above) in lieu of its internal authorization processing.

#### Principal Owner and Access Matrix Migration for Data Package Resources

For each data package, an entry in the **AuthZ** ACR registry for every data package resource, including the data package itself, will be required for the principal owner. This should be followed by migrating corresponding entries of each data package resource found in the `access_matrix` database table to the **AuthZ** ACR registry. (Note that data packages that are not represented in the `access_matrix` imply a full embargo of the data package exists and all access privileges, other than for the owner, are denied.)

1. An **AuthZ** `access_matrix` database table (see *AuthZ Access Control Rule Registry* [above](https://github.com/PASTAplus/PEP/blob/main/peps/pep-9.md#authz-access-control-rule-registry)).
2. 


#### Updating the Data Package Manager Service


## Open issue(s)

### 1. Will AuthZ support "deny" verbs in ACRs?

Because the "deny" verb is rarely used in practice, it will not be supported in the initial implementation of the AuthZ service. However, this feature may be added in a future release.

### 2. How will the current `DataPackageManager.access_matrix` table be migrated to the AuthZ ACR registry?

### 3. How will ezEML interact with the AuthZ service?

### 4. Will the data package "principal" owner be represented in the ACR registry?

Currently, the data package owner is passed to the "isAuthorized" method through a separate parameter, `principalOwner`, which is obtained by querying the data package manager resource registry. The `principalOwner` is compared to the submitter of the resource access request to determine if the submitter is the owner of the data package, and if so, the submitter is granted "changePermission" access to the data resource in question without the need for an ACR. This is an implicit ACR that is not stored in the ACR registry.

### 5. How will legacy `<access>` elements that contain IdP user identifiers and group identifiers work within the AuthZ service?

### 6. Should AuthZ expose a UI for managing ACRs or should each client application provide its own UI?
