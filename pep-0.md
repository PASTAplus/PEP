## What is a PEP?

In this context, PEP stands for **PASTA Enhancement Proposal**. The general idea
of a PEP is heavily borrowed from the Python community and uses their *Python
Enhancement Proposal* [process](https://peps.python.org/pep-0001). We are
fortunate that we can reuse the PEP acronym to our advantage: while the first
"P" in PEP is for "PASTA", we will extend it to all technical aspects within
the Environmental Data Initiative (EDI).

A PEP is a document that serves as a blueprint for EDI and its community. It
can introduce new features for EDI, or describe changes to its processes or
environment. Each PEP should contain a clear technical outline of the proposed
change, along with the reasoning behind it.

PEPs are the main way to suggest significant new features, gather feedback from
the community, and record the design choices made for EDI. The author of a
PEP is responsible for building agreement within the community and noting any
disagreements or concerns.

Since PEPs are stored as text files in a version-controlled repository, their
history is preserved. This means anyone can review how a PEP evolved over time,
either through git commands or by browsing the history on
[GitHub](https://github.com/PASTAplus/PEP).
